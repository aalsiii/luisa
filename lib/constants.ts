    text: "I met Luisa at Nada Yoga School, where she was translating for the Spanish yoga course. When she mentioned she was a professional photographer, it felt perfectly timed because I needed to learn photography for the school’s marketing work. Luisa patiently taught me how to use a professional camera and shared so much practical knowledge about photography. She’s an amazing teacher, very generous with her skills, and truly a great photographer. I’m really grateful for everything I learned from her.",
